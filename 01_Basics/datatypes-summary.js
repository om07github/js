//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
/**\
  Dynamic typing means you donâ€™t have to declare variable types explicitly.
  The type is determined at runtime, not during compilation.
  You can assign different types of values to the same variable during execution.
  In contrast, a statically typed language (like Java or C++) would not allow changing types like that without explicit casting or declaration.

// Stack(primitive), Heap(Non - primitive)

// stack => Creates a copy and changes occur in that
// Heap => Create changes in an original value 

let username = "Om"

let intermediate = username

//value get change for intermediate only username value reamin same

}
let userTwo = userOne
userTwo.email = "yash@gamil.com"
